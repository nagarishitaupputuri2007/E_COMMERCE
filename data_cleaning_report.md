# E-Commerce Data Cleaning Report

## 1. Overview
This report documents the data cleaning and preprocessing steps performed on the e-commerce dataset. The cleaning process was implemented using Python, with pandas as the primary data manipulation library.

### Dataset Information
- **Original Dataset**: ecommerce_data.csv
- **Cleaned Dataset**: ecommerce_data_cleaned.csv
- **Number of Records**: 20
- **Number of Original Columns**: 8
- **Number of Final Columns**: 13

## 2. Data Quality Issues and Solutions

### 2.1 Missing Values
**Issues Found:**
- No missing values were detected in any columns
- All columns had complete data

**Actions Taken:**
- No imputation was necessary
- Dataset maintained its completeness

### 2.2 Duplicate Records
**Issues Found:**
- Checked for duplicate orders using order_id
- No duplicate records were found

**Actions Taken:**
- No removal of duplicates was necessary
- Original data integrity maintained

### 2.3 Data Type Corrections
**Issues Found:**
- Date columns needed standardization
- Numeric columns needed proper typing
- Categorical columns needed optimization

**Actions Taken:**
- Converted 'order_date' to datetime format
- Converted 'amount' to float64
- Converted 'quantity' to int64
- Converted 'category' to categorical type for memory optimization

### 2.4 Category Standardization
**Issues Found:**
- Categories needed consistent formatting

**Actions Taken:**
- Standardized all category names to title case
- Stripped whitespace from category names
- Final categories:
  - Electronics
  - Sports & Fitness
  - Apparel
  - Health & Nutrition
  - Home & Kitchen

### 2.5 Outlier Analysis
**Issues Found:**
- Amount column: 3 outliers identified
  - Boundaries: -268.80 to 681.26
- Quantity column: No outliers
  - Boundaries: -0.88 to 4.12

**Actions Taken:**
- Generated boxplots for visual inspection (outliers_amount.png, outliers_quantity.png)
- Kept outliers as they represent legitimate high-value electronics purchases
- No trimming or capping was necessary

## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Time-Based Features
Added the following columns:
- `year`: Extracted from order_date
- `month`: Extracted from order_date
- `day_of_week`: Day name extracted from order_date

### 3.2 Business Metrics
Added the following columns:
- `total_revenue`: Calculated as quantity Ã— amount
- `customer_purchase_frequency`: Number of orders per customer

## 4. Data Validation

### 4.1 Final Checks Performed
- Negative values check:
  - No negative amounts found
  - No negative quantities found
- Date validation:
  - No future dates detected
- Data completeness:
  - All required columns present
  - No missing values in final dataset

## 5. Key Insights

### 5.1 Dataset Characteristics
- Clean, structured dataset with no quality issues
- Well-distributed categories covering major retail segments
- Reasonable value ranges for quantities (1-4 items per order)
- Some high-value transactions present in electronics category

### 5.2 Business Patterns
- Customer purchase frequency varies (some customers with multiple orders)
- Electronics category shows highest per-item value
- Order dates are properly distributed across different days of the week

## 6. Limitations and Assumptions
1. Outliers in amount column were assumed to be legitimate high-value purchases
2. Customer IDs and Product IDs were assumed to be correctly assigned
3. All transactions were assumed to be valid sales

## 7. Recommendations for Analysis
1. Focus on category-wise revenue analysis
2. Investigate customer purchase patterns using the frequency metric
3. Analyze daily and weekly sales trends
4. Examine the relationship between quantity and amount by category

## 8. Technical Implementation
The cleaning process was implemented in Python using the following libraries:
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization for outlier analysis
- datetime: Date handling and validation

The complete implementation can be found in `data_cleaning.py`.
