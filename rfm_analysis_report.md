# Customer Segmentation Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents a detailed analysis of customer segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics. The analysis aims to help understand customer behavior patterns and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Methodology
The analysis uses the RFM framework to segment customers:
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F)**: How often they make purchases

Each customer receives a score from 1-5 for each metric, with 5 being the best. These scores are then used to segment customers into distinct groups.
